# 8-Bit-Art
 This is one of my proudest projects, which I only started developing because I was trying to make a bullet-hell game during the summer and needed assets for it, went to find an online pixel drawing program, and realized I could just make my own. It hit a snag of not being able to do transparency (could not get the .png working), which about six months later I fixed within ten minutes of looking at it when I needed art assets for the Scientific Method game I made for a course project. It's an art program that focuses on low-resolution art and providing highly specific tools that I figured would be convenient, so I added them on an ongoing basis. I'm currently trying to make a better version of this that uses design principles and expands on its functionality.
